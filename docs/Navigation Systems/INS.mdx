:::tip Key Points

- Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) derive atitude, velocities and positions in any frame of reference from : [[Navbook]](#1)
  - Three-dimentional acceleration readings (obtained using an accelerometer)
  - Three-dimentional angular velocity readings (obtained using a gyroscope).
- INS can provide : [[Collinson]](#2) [[Navbook]](#1)
  - Accurate position in whatever frame of coordinate needed
  - Groud speed and track angle
  - Euler angles (heading, pitch, roll) with high accuracy
- Moreover, some of the INS advantages are : [[Navbook]](#1) [[Collinson]](#2)
  - unjammable
  - self-contained
  - autonomous (no reliance on sattelite constellation for example)
However, high-accuracy Inertial Navigation Systems are expensive and heavy compared to Satellite Navigation Systems. [[Navbook]](#1)

Imagine you are on a train at night, and you would like to know :
- How fast is the train going?
- Where are we positioned with respect to our station of origin?
- Are the track slopped?
- How much distance have we traveled?

There is a way to answer all of those questions using only two devices: an accelerometer and a gyroscope. We will first look at ways to model accelerometers and gyroscopes and then show how to answer some of the questions above.

### Accelerometer Model [[Navbook]](#1)

There are multiple ways to build accelerometers but all work on a common principle : a mass-spring system. Measuring the compression or stretching imposed by the inertia of the mass —also called *proof mass*— during an acceleration of the sensor's frame of reference can be used to determine the frame of reference's acceleration, should the system's properties be known with sufficient precision. 

Neglecting friction, we can model the measured force to be : [[Navbook]](#1)

$$\overrightarrow{f}=\frac{\overrightarrow{F}}{m}=\overrightarrow{a}^I - \overrightarrow{g}$$

Where : 
- $\overrightarrow{F}$ is the force measured by the accelerometer
- $m$ is the proof mass
- $\overrightarrow{f}$ is known as the specific force
- $\overrightarrow{a}^I$ is the acceleration with respect to the inertial frame of reference —also reffered to as inertial acceleration
- $\overrightarrow{g}$ is the acceleration of of the local gravity field

In order to implement an inertial navigation algorithm, we are interested in measuring $\overrightarrow{a}^I$. Unfortunately, as with any physically realisable sensor, the measurement of the specific force is corrupted, usually modelled as additive bias $\overrightarrow{b}$ [[Navbook]](#1).
We can thus rewrite the acceleration measured in a fictitious direction $\overrightarrow{e_m}$ as : [[Navbook]](#1) 

$$a_m = \overrightarrow{f} \cdot \overrightarrow{e_m} = (\overrightarrow{a}^I - \overrightarrow{g}) \cdot \overrightarrow{e_m} + \overrightarrow{b} \cdot \overrightarrow{e_m}$$

There is also a second type of measurement contamination : random-error, usually denoted $\nu$. [Navbook]](#1) 
We can write the specific force as a function of time as : 

$$f_{\textrm{meas}}(t)=a(t)+b(t)+\nu(t)$$

:::caution
A detailed error model is necessary in order to get an accurate measurement from the accelerometer. Not knowing $b$ or the expected value of $\nu$ of will lead to a $O(t^2)$ error in the position. Indeed, Collinson stated: "An accelerometer bias error of $10^{−3}$ g will produce a distance error of 0.45 km after 5 minutes and 1.8 km after 10 minutes, for example." [[Collinson]](#2). This leads to a need for costly, sometimes heavy, high-performance equipment.

### Gyroscope Model [[Navbook]](#1)
One of the common technology used in inertial navigation for building a gyroscope if the Ring Laser gyroscope. [[Navbook]](#1)
They work on the principle of standing wave interference. Two laser beams of the same wavelength are emmited at opposite end of a circular optical fiber. 
*Demonstration on how to obtain estimate of angular velocity from counting half wavelenght fringes to be added if necessary*
Since Ring Laser Gyroscopes measure the angular velocity, they are often reffered to as *rate gyros*. As with the accelerometer, the measurement is corrupted by additive bias $b_g$ and random error $\nu$.
Thus we get : [[Navbook]](#1)
$$\omega_g (t) = \overrightarrow{\omega}^{BI} \cdot \overrightarrow{e}_{m} + b_g + \nu$$ 

### Attitude Derivation [[Collinson]](#2)

In this section, we look at how to derive the aircraft's attidude from the accelerometer and gyroscope readings.
#### Gimballed Systems
Initially, INS systems have been built using the gimball method where the sensors are mounted on a gimballed platform. The gyroscope control a set of servos which will be used to keep the platform at rest with respect to intertial space. The euler angles can then be read directly. However, this method result in increased mechanical complexity as well as being subject to gimbal lock.

#### Strap-down Systems 

A more modern approach consist by mounting the sensors directly to the aircraft's body. The measurement are thus made with respect to the aircraft's body frane of reference. Euler angles can be computed from the rates and, using a transition matrix.

<!-- [https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ojulg5rdhjow5q/aircraft-body-ins-strapped-down.jpg?raw=1] -->

<Figure caption="Strap down system schematic. Taken from G., C. R. P. (2011)." figIndex="1" linkToImage="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ojulg5rdhjow5q/aircraft-body-ins-strapped-down.jpg?raw=1"></Figure>

The Euler angles are defined as : 
- $\Phi$, the bank angle
- $\theta$, the pitch angle
- $\psi$, the yaw angle.

We can then use the following transition matrix to obtain $\dot{\Phi}$, $\dot{\theta}$ and $\dot{\psi}$ from $p$, $q$ and $r$. [[Collinson]](#2)

$$\begin{bmatrix} \dot{\Phi} \\ \dot{\theta} \\ \dot{\psi}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 && \textrm{sin} \Phi \textrm{tan} \theta && \textrm{cos}\Phi\textrm{tan}\theta \\ 0 && \textrm{cos} \Phi && -\textrm{sin}\Phi \\ 0 && \textrm{sin}\Phi \textrm{sec}\theta && \textrm{cos}\Phi \textrm{sec}\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} p\\ q\\ r\end{bmatrix}$$

It must be noted, however, that this should be limited to pitch angles of $\pm 30\deg$ due to the singularities created by high angular values of $\textrm{tan}$ and $\textrm{sec}$ (infinite at $90 \deg$).

##### Equivalent Stable Platform Method
