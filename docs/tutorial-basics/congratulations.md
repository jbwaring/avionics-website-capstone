# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of Docusaurus** and made some changes to the **initial template**.

Docusaurus has **much more to offer**!

Have **5 more minutes**? Take a look at **[versioning](../tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions.md)** and **[i18n](../tutorial-extras/translate-your-site.md)**.

Anything **unclear** or **buggy** in this tutorial? [Please report it!](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/4610)
$$\frac{1}{b}$$
Let $f:[a,b] \to \R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F:[a,b]\to\R$ be $F(x)=
\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt$. Then $$F$$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$, $F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$.
## What's next?

- Read the [official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/).
- Add a custom [Design and Layout](https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout)
- Add a [search bar](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search)
- Find inspirations in the [Docusaurus showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase)
- Get involved in the [Docusaurus Community](https://docusaurus.io/community/support)
